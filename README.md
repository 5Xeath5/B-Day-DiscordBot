# B-Day-DiscordBot
First personal project, installing this bot into a server will allow for people to input their birthdays and receive a message along with a gif on their birthday
Will require pip installation of 'hikari-lightbulb'

Looking at it now.... highly inefficient way of storing days and users, more usage of oop would help clean up some of the code. Might redo in the future if needed.
